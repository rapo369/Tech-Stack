Non-SSH connection types
As stated in the previous section, Ansible executes playbooks over SSH but it is not limited to this connection type. With the host specific parameter ansible_connection=<connector>, the connection type can be changed. The following non-SSH based connectors are available:

local

This connector can be used to deploy the playbook to the control machine itself.

docker

This connector deploys the playbook directly into Docker containers using the local Docker client. The following parameters are processed by this connector:

ansible_host
The name of the Docker container to connect to.
ansible_user
The user name to operate within the container. The user must exist inside the container.
ansible_become
If set to true the become_user will be used to operate within the container.
ansible_docker_extra_args
Could be a string with any additional arguments understood by Docker, which are not command specific. This parameter is mainly used to configure a remote Docker daemon to use.
Here is an example of how to instantly deploy to created containers:

- name: create jenkins container
  docker_container:
    docker_host: myserver.net:4243
    name: my_jenkins
    image: jenkins

- name: add container to inventory
  add_host:
    name: my_jenkins
    ansible_connection: docker
    ansible_docker_extra_args: "--tlsverify --tlscacert=/path/to/ca.pem --tlscert=/path/to/client-cert.pem --tlskey=/path/to/client-key.pem -H=tcp://myserver.net:4243"
    ansible_user: jenkins
  changed_when: false

- name: create directory for ssh keys
  delegate_to: my_jenkins
  file:
    path: "/var/jenkins_home/.ssh/jupiter"
    state: directory
